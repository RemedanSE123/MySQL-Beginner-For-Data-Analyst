## Beginner SQL Commands

| **SQL Command** | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **SELECT**      | Retrieves data from one or more tables in the database. You can specify which columns to select or use `*` to select all columns. |
| **WHERE**       | Filters records that meet a specified condition. It helps you extract specific data by applying conditions to the columns. |
| **GROUP BY**    | Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data. It’s often used with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`. |
| **ORDER BY**    | Sorts the results of a query in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order based on one or more columns. |
| **HAVING**      | Filters records after an aggregation is performed. It is used with `GROUP BY` to specify conditions on the aggregated data. |
| **LIMIT**       | Limits the number of rows returned by a query, useful when you need a specific number of results. |
| **ALIAS**       | Temporarily renames a table or column for the purpose of a particular query. Aliases make the results more readable or help in complex queries. |
